PyTorch implementation of the paper "Automatic Chemical Design Using a Data-Driven Continuous Representation of Molecules" by Gómez-Bombarelli, et al. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02415). Training was done using ChEMBL Dataset which can be found [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). Comparison was done between the paper's architecture and a simpler Fully connected Encoder Decoder, and the results were verified.
