Very frequently while reading something I think, "Woah, this is really cool I'll use it next time I work on a related project" and subsequently forget what that thing was when needed. So these blogs are short summaries of methods and papers I read and find really useful. 
If you like any of these or they helped you, please let me know it will definetly motivate me to write more. Also if you have any suggestions or comments also let me know.
