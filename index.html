<p>
Currently, I am involved in actively contributing to <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/ignite"> PyTorch-ignite </a>, which is a High-level library to help with training and evaluating neural networks
</p>
<p>
During the Summer of 2021, I worked as an Tech Intern in the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence at <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/deloitte-analytics/articles/advancing-human-ai-collaboration.html">  Deloitte </a>.
</p>

<p>
During the period of April to Nov of 2020, I worked with <a href="https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/">Video Analytics Lab</a>, IISc on a task of Self Supervised Hand Mesh Detection and Color Recovery. The purpose of doing this in a self supervised manner was to use the large number of unlabelled data available on the internet and makes the model more robust since its trained on real world outdoors data also.

<p>
In the summer of 2020, I worked with <a href="http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/">CNeRG Group</a>, IIT Kharagpur on a task of Question Answering on the AmazonQA Dataset. It was a Reading Comprehension task where the the questions had to be answered using the reviews as context.

<h1> Interests </h1>
<p>
I am exploring work at the interesection of Machine Learning with
 Chemistry and Language, doing so to solve real world problems
</p>

<p>
Recently I have gained interest in the field of using <em>Deep Learning on Molecular Data for Activity Prediction</em>. I worked on a course project on the topic <i>"Generating Molecular Embeddings for QSAR using Adversarial Autoencoder"</i> for the course IEE-03 Artifical Neural Networks and Applications. This project was also awarded the best course project award by the Professor. I am looking to undertake more work to explore this area further.
